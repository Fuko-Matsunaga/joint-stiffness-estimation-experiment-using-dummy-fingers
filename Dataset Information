Column Name
stiffness: target stiffness value (Nmm/deg)
p0 - d0: joint angle at each pressure value (deg)
  - p0 - p70: the joint angles measured at 0 - 70 kPa of pressurization
  - max80: the joint angle measured at a maximum air pressure of 80 kPa
  - d70 - d0: the joint angles measured at 70 - 0kPa of depressurization
theta0: resting angle (deg)

The datasets are in folders for each dummy finger size
small size and large size folders: datasets measured in the experiments with the small and large-sized dummy fingers in CSV files by joint are contained
