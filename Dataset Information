The datasets are in folders for each dummy finger size and contained in CSV files for each joint.

- medium size folder: four folders containing datasets measured in the experiments with the medium-sized dummy finger
  - medium dataset: the model training and test datasets were created by splitting this dataset
  - training dataset: dataset used to train the models (part of the medium dataset)
  - test dataset ("M-Test" in the article): dataset used to test the models (part of the medium dataset)
  - high stiffness dataset ("H-Prediction" in the article): dataset used for generality validation

- small size folder ("S-Prediction" in the article): dataset measured in the experiment with the small-sized dummy finger is contained

- large size folder ("L-Prediction" in the article): dataset measured in the experiment with the large-sized dummy finger is contained



Column Name
stiffness: target stiffness value (Nmm/deg)
p0 - d0: joint angle at each pressure value (deg)
  - p0 - p70: the joint angles measured at 0 - 70 kPa of pressurization
  - max80: the joint angle measured at a maximum air pressure of 80 kPa
  - d70 - d0: the joint angles measured at 70 - 0kPa of depressurization
theta0: resting angle (deg)
