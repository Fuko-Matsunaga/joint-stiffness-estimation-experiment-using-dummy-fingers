# Datasets of Joint Stiffness Estimation Experiment using Dummy Fingers

In here we provide datasets measured in prototype experiments of finger joint stiffness estimation using dummy fingers: 

Used for the article submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters titled: "Learning-Based Accurate Finger Joint Stiffness Estimation with Joint Modular Soft Actuators"

Dataset infomation are detailed on: Dataset Infomation (Include details of the column names of the dataset and each folder, etc.)
